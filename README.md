# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle Titanic competition. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The Titanic competition is a classic binary classification problem. The objective is to predict survival based on features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two CSV files:

- `train.csv`: Training data with features and survival labels.
- `test.csv`: Test data for prediction.

Key features include:

- `PassengerId`
- `Pclass`
- `Name`
- `Sex`
- `Age`
- `SibSp`
- `Parch`
- `Ticket`
- `Fare`
- `Cabin`
- `Embarked`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danyalatbracket/kaggle_competation_titanic.git
   cd kaggle_competation_titanic
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Analyzed missing values and feature distributions.
- Visualized survival rates by gender, class, and age.
- Identified important features for modeling.

## Feature Engineering

- Imputed missing values (e.g., Age, Embarked).
- Created new features (e.g., FamilySize, Title).
- Converted categorical variables to numeric.

## Modeling

- Tried multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
- Used cross-validation for model selection.
- Tuned hyperparameters for best performance.

## Results

- Achieved an accuracy of XX% on the public leaderboard.
- Feature importance analysis showed `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Age` as key predictors.

## Usage

1. Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the project directory.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The predictions will be saved as `submission.csv`.
